# GenAI Agents Tutorials

This repository contains tutorials for various AI agent frameworks, demonstrating different approaches to building and deploying AI agents. Each framework has its own dedicated section with example implementations and use cases.

## Frameworks

### OpenAI Agents SDK
[OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python) is the official SDK from OpenAI for building AI agents. It provides a simple yet powerful way to create AI agents that can use tools and make decisions.

**Tutorials:**
1. [Basic Agent Implementation](AgentSDK/01_basic_agent.ipynb) - Learn how to create a simple AI agent with asynchronous operations.

### AutoGen
[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) is a framework that enables the development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks.

**Tutorials:**
*(Coming Soon)*

### CrewAI
[CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) is a framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. By working together, these agents can tackle complex tasks through human-like collaboration.

**Tutorials:**
*(Coming Soon)*

### LangGraph
[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, built on top of LangChain.

**Tutorials:**
*(Coming Soon)*
